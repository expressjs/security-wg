### expressjs/security-wg

* Proposal: Move scorecards into a single repo [#31](https://github.com/expressjs/security-wg/issues/31)
  * Explore if this is feasible, currently seems like there are some features that requires the workflow to run in the repository like the branch rules detection
  * Tobias is willing to help
  * the idea here will be to review the scorecard scoring in every monthly meeting
  * Discussion around supply chain (for us): 
     * How deep do we want to track out dependencies? 
     * We might want to focus on the licenses first? 
* Proposal: add repository security advisory #30
  * We are ok to enable it, but we want to do it at org level and once the security policy is updated
  * We need to update the security policy to include a email (mail alias). Currently we are working with the foundation into this.
